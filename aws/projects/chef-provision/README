To avoid hard-coding credentials and regions into the Terraform files,
the ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config files have been used.

This example will provision a single instance and provision it with
chef, by pointing to a managed chef server at manage.chef.io

1. run 'terraform init'
2. Create the terraform file (devops-eval.tf)

3. run 'terraform apply' to make the AWS infrastructure changes
4. To tear down all reasources and start again run 'terraform destory'
